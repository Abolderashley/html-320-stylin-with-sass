<div>
  <p>A very common problem is to define a section of your page with
    elements that are based upon <span class="green">floats</span>.</p>
  <p class="fragment">You have to "clear" your floats before you begin the next
  section, or else the browser will cram the next bit up against the
    last float.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The most common method in use today uses the
  pseudo-elements <span class="green">:before</span>
  and <span class="green">:after</span> to handle the clear, avoiding
    the need to create extra markup.</p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Often a <span class="green">.clearfix</span> class is used on
    elements, but here we're going to build it in via a mixin.<p>
