## Installing Ruby

* **Windows users:** go to <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org" target="_blank" title="Ruby Installer for Windows">RubyInstaller.org</a>
and follow the instructions to install **both** Ruby and the Ruby DevKit (under Add-Ons).

* **Mac users:** you may have it a little easier, as Ruby may already be installed. Try this:

<pre class="narrow"><code class="command-line">ruby --version</code></pre>

* If the value returned is less
than **2.0.0**, you will need to install
a newer version. Ask a TA for assistance.
