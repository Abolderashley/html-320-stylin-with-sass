* Jekyll is a **static site generator** which has Sass support built in.

* This makes it super for building web sites that are mainly static text and styles, while keeping your work **DRY**.

* It has nice templating features, layouts, includes, data
  manipulation, and you can write in **Markdown**

* Jekyll sites can be hosted directly on {% include link.html link=page.gh_pages %}
