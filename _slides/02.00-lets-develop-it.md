In the following section, we're going to take the project you
cloned and turn it into one that uses Sass.

Open the project in your editor (remember to open the whole project).
{:.fragment}

Open the `README.md` file for the project. Read it all the way through
and then go back and follow the instructions.

From the command line, check out the first exercise, and then start up
the watcher

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b exercise/01-new-sass-folder \
    origin/exercise/01-new-sass-folder
npm start
{% endhighlight %}

You should be able to keep the watcher running throughout the
exercise, but you may want to shut it down when we move on.

#### For the exercise, you're going to:

&nbsp;

1. create a directory for our SCSS files
2. move / rename the CSS files from the `css` folder to the new `sass` folder
3. change the ending on the file from `css` to `scss`

&nbsp;

It is possible that the watcher won't work at this point, so go ahead
and stop it with Ctrl+C and restart it.
