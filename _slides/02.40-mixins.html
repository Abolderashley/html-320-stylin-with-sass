<div class="">
  <p>
    <span class="green">Mixins</span> are just collections of style
    attributes that can be reused, similarly to the way variables
    allow the reuse of values.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    These come in very handy for CSS effects, such as
    <span class="fragment green">gradients,</span>
    <span class="fragment green">drop shadows,</span>
    <span class="fragment green"> CSS3 rules that need browser prefixes,</span>
    <span class="fragment green">clearing floats before and/or
      after.</span>

  </p>
</div>
