<div>
<ul>
  <li>Open your <span class="blue">styles.scss</span> file</li>
  <li>Rewrite some styles to use nesting and referencing the parent</li>
  <li>Look for selectors that share a common parent HTML element, like header, nav, footer, #main</li>
  <li>Look for hover styles, or add some, to practice referencing the parent with <span class="blue">&</span>
</li>
  <li>There are lots of possible solutions! Be creative!</li>
  <li>Run the <code class="pink">sass --watch command</code> to see your changes in the browser</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Your <code class="pink">sass --watch</code> command might still
    be running from before. It's quite
    okay if it is, it will pick up the edits as you go along saving
    your changes and re-compile the changed .scss files into .css. You
    should just need to keep refreshing your browser as usual.
