## {{page.title}}

Sass actually has two dialects:

</section>

<section>

#### {{page.title}} - Sass

**Sass:** stripped down, white-space indented, terse; does not look like CSS

{% highlight sass %}
nav
  ul
    list-style: none
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section>

#### {{page.title}} - SCSS

**SCSS:** keeps all the braces ("squirly brackets") and semi-colons that you have in CSS. White space doesn't matter.

{% highlight scss %}
nav {
  ul {
    list-style: none;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Plain CSS is already SCSS, it's the easiest to start with.

For this course, I'll be showing you the SCSS dialect.

The <a target="_blank" href="{{site.url | append:
site.baseurl}}/print.html">print notes</a> shows the Sass version as
well.
