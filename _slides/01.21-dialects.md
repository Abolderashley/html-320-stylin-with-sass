### Sass Dialects

Sass actually has two dialects:

</section>

<section>

* **Sass:** stripped down, white-space indented, terse; does not look like CSS

<pre><code class="sass css">nav
  ul
    list-style: none</code></pre>

</section>

<section>

* **SCSS:** keeps all the braces ("squirly brackets") and semi-colons that you have in CSS. White space doesn't matter.


<pre><code class="sass css">nav {
  ul {
    list-style: none;
  }
}</code></pre>


</section>

<section>

For this course, I'll be showing you the SCSS dialect.
Plain CSS is already SCSS, so you can make changes gradually.

The <a target="_blank" href="{{site.url | append: site.baseurl}}/print.html">print notes</a> will have both so you can compare.
