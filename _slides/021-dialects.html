title: "Sass Dialects"

<p class="left-align">
  Sass actually has two dialects:
</p>

<ul class="p-tb-20">
  <li>
    <span class="green">Sass:</span> stripped down, white-space indented, terse; does not
    look like CSS
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="green">SCSS:</span> keeps all the braces ("squirly brackets") and semi-colons
    that you have in CSS. White space doesn't matter.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="left-align">
  For this course, I'll be showing you the SCSS dialect on the
  slides. The
  <a target="_blank"
     href="{{site.url | append: site.baseurl}}/print.html">
    print notes
  </a>
  will have both so you can compare.
</p>
