## {{page.title}}

In your terminal (or Ruby+Bash), enter the following:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install sass --user-install
sass --version
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section class="left-align gowide">

## {{page.title}}

This is what you should see:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install sass --user-install
Successfully installed sass-3.4.22
1 gem installed
$ sass --version
Sass 3.4.22 (Selective Steve)
{% endhighlight %}

If you see the version printed out, you've successfully installed sass! (It might not be the same version number, that's okay.)

## {{page.title}}

When you installed `sass`, you might have seen the following warning
message:

{% highlight text %}
WARNING:  You donâ€™t have /Users/noob/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin in your PATH,
gem executables will not run.
{% endhighlight %}

(The specifics of that path might be slightly different.)

* This means you have do a little more work to set up your command line
environment to work with `sass`.
* This is typical for beginning command
line users, don't fret.
* This is mainly on OSX as well.

### Home directory

* Make sure you are in your home directory.
* When you start Terminal, you
are in your home directory.
* Type `pwd` (print working directory) to
see what it is.
* Then type `echo $HOME`; the output should be the same.
* The output should be something like `/Users/yourfirstname` but it
might be slightly different.

### Adding to the PATH environment variable

In the terminal, type `touch .bash_profile`.

Then open this file in your editor and add the line:

{% highlight bash %}
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin
{% endhighlight %}

to the file.

* If there's already something in the file, search to see
if the `PATH` variable is being set similarly, and add the above line
after it.
* Save it and close the tab with the file.

### Initializing the command line

Go back to your terminal and type the following:

{% highlight bash %}
$ source $HOME/.bash_profile
$ echo $PATH # -> you should see the path from the warning
$ which sass # -> this will show which sass program will run
$ sass --version
{% endhighlight %}

### Output from the last set of steps

Your terminal should look something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ source $HOME/.bash_profile
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/noob/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin
$ which sass
/Users/noob/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin/sass
$ sass --version
Sass 3.4.22 (Selective Steve)
{% endhighlight %}
