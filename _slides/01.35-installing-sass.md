## Installing Sass

In your terminal (or Ruby+Bash), enter the following:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install sass --user-install
sass --version
{% endhighlight %}

This is what you should see:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install sass --user-install
Successfully installed sass-3.4.22
1 gem installed
$ sass --version
Sass 3.4.22 (Selective Steve)
{% endhighlight %}

If you see the version printed out, you've successfully installed sass! (It might not be the same version number, that's okay.)
