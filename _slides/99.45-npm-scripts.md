## npm scripts

Often overlooked, the `npm` tool has a provision to run basic shell
scripts.

The `package.json` file that is used to install `nodejs` packages has
a section called `scripts` in which you can add your own.

### Example:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "grunt test",
    "start": "bundle exec jekyll serve",
    "build": "bundle exec jekyll build --config=_config.yml,_build.yml",
    "publish": "npm run build && (cd _dist && git add --all && git commit && git push)"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

### Invocation:

You call the script via `npm run SCRIPTNAME`.

If you have a script labeled "start", then run `npm start` to run that
script.

The scripts themselves are just command line one-liners.
