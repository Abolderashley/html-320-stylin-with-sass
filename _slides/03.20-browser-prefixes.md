title: "CSS3 Browser Prefixes"

There are a lot of newer features in CSS3 that require <span
class="green">browser prefixes</span>. These are well-suited to mixins
so we don't have to copy-paste a lot of duplicate code.

* Chrome, Safari, Android Browser: <span class="green">`-webkit-`</span>
* Firefox, Gecko: <span class="green">`-moz-`</span>
* Opera: <span class="green">`-o-`</span>
* Internet Explorer: <span class="green">`-ms-`</span>

Eventually support for newer styles becomes built-in to each browser
and you no longer need the prefix.

Modern website development doesn't bother with this. There are tools
which will modify your css so it contains just the necessary browser
prefixes.

See [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) which
can be used with webpack, grunt, and gulp.
