    Jekyll is a <span class="green">static site generator</span> which
    has Sass support built in.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    This makes it super for building web sites that are mainly static
    text and styles, while keeping your work <span class="green">DRY</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    It has nice templating features, layouts, includes, data
    manipulation, and you can write
    in <span class="green">Markdown</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    <span class="green">Jekyll</span> sites can be hosted directly on
    {% include link.html link=page.gh_pages %}
  </p>
