title: "The Sass Watch Command"
---

<div class="left-align">
  <p>Let's break this command down - you're going to use it *a lot*!</p>
  <pre><code class="sass css">sass --watch scss:css</code></pre>
  <p class="fragment">The <code class="pink">--watch</code> option tells Sass to look for changes to our .scss files, and to compile them to css if they have updates.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The <code class="pink">scss</code> bit is the folder where our .scss files live. We edit these files only.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The <code class="pink">css</code> part is the folder where our .css files will be. These files are the compiled output of our Sass, and are only created when we run the above command.</p>
</div>
