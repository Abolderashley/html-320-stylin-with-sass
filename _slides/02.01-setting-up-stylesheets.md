## Setting up Stylesheets

<div class="left-align">
  <p>Make sure you have downloaded and unzipped the {% include
  link.html link=site.long_urls.files %}.</p>
  <p>We need to structure our stylesheets before we can compile them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>open the <span class="blue">"project_files/class1-exercises/practice"</span> <span class="green">folder</span> in your editor</li>
    <li>go ahead and open <a href="project_files/class1-exercises/practice/index.html" target="_blank">project_files/class1-exercises/practice/index.html</a> in a browser</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Setting up Stylesheets (continued)

* rename the two CSS files in the `/stylesheets/` directory to have a `.scss` file extension
* create two directories in the `/stylesheets/` directory:
  *`css`
  * `scss`
* move the .scss files inside the `sccs` folder
* create an empty file in the `css` directory:


{% highlight bash %}
touch stylesheets/css/.keep
{% endhighlight %}

#### Setting up Stylesheets (continued)

The result should look like:

{% highlight bash %}
/stylesheets/
  /css/
    .keep
  /scss/
    /font/
    reset.scss
    styles.scss
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section>
#### Setting up Stylesheets (continued)

Update your `index.html` stylesheet url in the `<head>` portion
to point to `/stylesheets/css/`:


{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="stylesheets/css/reset.css">
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="stylesheets/css/style.css">
{% endhighlight %}

Save all your files, and refresh your browser

Looks funky, doesn't it?

<aside class="notes">

In your `.gitignore` file, you should add the following two lines:

{% highlight bash %}
/stylesheets/css/
!/stylesheets/css/.keep
{% endhighlight %}

This is so the css directory will be present in the repo, should
you choose to clone it elsewhere, but the contents of that
directory will not be saves. This is because the CSS files are now
being created with <code>sass</code>!
