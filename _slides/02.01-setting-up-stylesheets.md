#### {{page.title}}

Make sure you have downloaded and unzipped the {% include link.html
link=site.long_urls.files %} to a directory on your computer.

I suggest `~/GDIClasses/`.

#### {{page.title}} (continued)

Read through the {% include link.html link=page.readme_link %}
file to understand how to prepare your working folders.

* change to the practice folder's stylesheets folder:
* create two directories in the `/stylesheets/` directory:
  * `css`
  * `scss`
* move and rename the css files into the scss folder
* move the font folder to the css folder
* commit your changes

### Command lines:

{% highlight bash %}
cd stylesheets
mkdir css scss
mv reset.css scss/reset.scss
mv styles.css scss/styles.scss
mv font css
cd ..
git add --all -v
git commit -m "convert css file to scss"
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

#### {{page.title}} (continued)

The resulting structure should look like this:

{% highlight bash %}
/stylesheets/
  css/
    font/
  scss
    reset.scss
    styles.scss
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section>

#### {{page.title}} (continued)

Update your `index.html` stylesheet url in the `<head>` portion
to point to `/stylesheets/css/`:


{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="stylesheets/css/reset.css">
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="stylesheets/css/style.css">
{% endhighlight %}

Since the generated css files are now under `/stylesheets/css/` you
have to tell the `index.html` page to load them from there.

Save all your files, **commit them**, and refresh your browser

Looks funky, doesn't it?
