# Description for Meetup.com

* Course Title: *Stylin' with Sass*
* Cost: $48
* Duration: 4 hours
* Instructor: Tamara Temple

## What you'll learn

**Turn your CSS Sassy**

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a
pre-processor that provides you with a great ability to easily specify
and describe your CSS in a structured and programmatic way. Imagine
being able to try out a different colour scheme for your site by
changing only 3 or 4 lines of one file. Or defining reusable stylistic
components that can be mixed into other style elements, again so you
only have to change them in one spot in your files.

Sass provides a modern, computer-driven way to create a superb style
for your web sites. It’s used by many, many designers, front-end
developers, web teams, and projects. Many of the modern CSS
frameworks, including Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation, deliver
their frameworks in Sass. Most of the static site generators such as
Jekyll, Middleman, Harp, and CodeKit, include Sass compilation already
built-in.

This workshop will teach you how to create Sass-based style systems,
compile them, and include them in your web site projects.
