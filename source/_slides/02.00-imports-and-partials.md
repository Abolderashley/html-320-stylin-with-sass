### Imports and Partials

Sass extends the `@import` function from CSS to create the concept of
a *partial*.

A partial is a segment of Sass code in a file with a name that begins
with an underscore (`_`). Such files are treated differently by Sass:
{:.fragment}

* if a file starts with an underscore, *do not* compile a separate
  `.css` file for it.
* otherwise, compile a `.css` file
{:.fragment}
