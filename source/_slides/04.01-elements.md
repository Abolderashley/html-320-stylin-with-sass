### Section 4: Elements

<div class="left-align">

* Styling Bare HTML Elements, after resets

In a given, existing project, or in a brand new project, you want to
pull all the bare HTML elements into the `_elements.scss` file. This
builds on the resets and normalizing that is done in the General
section.

* No classes used here, just element selectors

You don't specify any classes here, these are what is applied to all
bare elements.
{:.notes}

* Can break out into further partials if desired

It might be helpful to lump certain elements together in separate
partial files, for example: `_headings.scss` can hold all the `h1`,
`h2`, etc, element tag stylines. This will be true as we go futher
along as well.
