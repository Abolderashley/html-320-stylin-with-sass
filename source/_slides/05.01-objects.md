### Section 5: Objects

</section>

### Finding Objects

* Objects are usually big-ticket items, such as:
  * your site's template (header, footer, main content, sidebars)
  * a grid system defining reusable classes for column widths
  * other reusable objects such as the classic "Media Object"

</section>





<section>

### Some rules (guidelines)

* don't use elements for CSS selectors
* don't use IDs for CSS selectors
* everything is a class

<div class="notes">

* using elements as styling selectors breaks the notion of general to
  explicit specificity. It means you have to design around their use
  in other contexts.

* IDs can be used, but don't use them for CSS; use them for JavaScript
  and in-page references.
