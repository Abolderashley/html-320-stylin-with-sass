title: What is Sass?

<section>

### {{ page.title }}

Sass is a command-line tool that
**pre-processes** your CSS files to allow you
to create modular, DRY, and easily maintainable style information.

Sass has two dialects:

<ul>
<li class="fragment">SCSS (Sassy CSS)</li>
<li class="fragment">Indented Sass</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>

**Indented Form:** stripped down, white-space indented, terse; does
not look like CSS (called "Sass")

{% highlight sass %}
nav
  ul
    list-style: none
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section>

**Sassy Form:** keeps all the braces ("squirly brackets") and
semi-colons that you have in CSS. White space doesn't
matter. (called "SCSS")

{% highlight scss %}
nav {
  ul {
    list-style: none;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Plain CSS is already SCSS, it's the easiest to start with.

For this course, I'll be showing you the SCSS dialect.

<small>The
[printed notes]({{ '/print.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:target="_blank"}
show the Sass version as
well.</small>
