### Comments!

There are two types of comments, ones which are passed through to the
CSS and ones which are not.

**Start with SCSS**

{% highlight scss %}
/* Multi-line comments
 * are passed through
 */
// single line comments are not
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="notes">

**or Sass**

{% highlight sass %}
/* Multi-line comments
  * are passed through
  *
// single line comments are not
body
  margin: 0
  padding: 0
{% endhighlight %}

</div>

**End with CSS**

{% highlight css %}
/* Multi-line comments
 * are passed through
 */
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0; }
{% endhighlight %}
