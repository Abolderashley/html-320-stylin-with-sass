### Section 10: Theming

*Now we're gonna have fun!*
{:.green}

* Theming is one of the coolest things, because with just a couple
  changes, you can completely change the look of your site.
* It requires extracting colors from the existing elements, objects,
  and components, and creating modifiers that can easily be applied
  that affect the color theme.
* In addition to colors, fonts are often another area of theming.
