### Section 9: The Feature Section

* On our page, there are 3 big globs of space that are denoted by
`<section>` elements.
* The have some common features and some disparate features.
* We can create a component for the common features, and reuse it for
  each section.
* We've already created a separate component for the interior
  structure in the famous women section.
* We can also create a separate component for the interior structures
  in the other two sections.
