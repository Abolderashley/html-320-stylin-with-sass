### {{page.title}} Example SCSS


{% highlight scss %}
/* Multi-line comments
 * are passed through
 */
// single line comments are not
$layoutWidth: 960px;

body {
  width: $layoutWidth;
}

{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section>

### {{page.title}} Compiled CSS


{% highlight css %}
/* Multi-line comments
 * are passed through
 */
body {
  width: 960px; }
{% endhighlight %}


</section>

<aside class="notes">


{% highlight sass %}
/* Multi-line comments
  * are passed through
  */
// single line comments are not
$layoutWidth: 960px
body
  width: $layoutWidth
{% endhighlight %}

**NOTE:** In Sass dialect, you have to preserve the indentation on the
multiline comment, so the parser understands that it's part of the
comment body. This can be rather disconcting at first, but given
the nature of white-space indent parsers, it does make sense.
