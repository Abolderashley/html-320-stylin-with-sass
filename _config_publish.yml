# When performing the Jekyll build for publishing, include this file:

#   jekyll build --config=_config.yml,_config_publish.yml

# The URL portion is what is substituted in site.url
# in the slides. By default, use the GDIMpls Github Pages
# prefix, and the baseurl setting in _config.yml
# for the repository name.
baseurl: "/html-320-stylin-with-sass"
url: "https://gdiminneapolis.github.io"

# If you fork something from the GDIMpls repo into your own repo, and
# use the same publish to Github track, your version will be availble
# at the url "https://<yourgithub>.github.io/<repo-name/". This could
# generate some confusion when contributing to the GDIMpls
# repo. **BEWARE**
